# ðŸš€ Fastify-starter

Fastify starter template with Typescript, Prisma and Vitest

### Requirements

- Node.js and [bun](https://bun.sh) (or npm, yarn, pnpm)

### Getting started

#### 1. Download starter and install dependencies

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/pierreberger/fastify-starter.git my-project-name
cd my-project-name
bun install
```

#### 2. Set the environment variables:

```shell
cp .env.example .env

# open .env and modify the environment variables (if needed)
```

#### 3. Create and seed the database

Run the following command to create your SQLite database file. This also creates
the `User` and `Post` tables that are defined in
[`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

```shell
bun prisma migrate dev --name init
```

#### 4. Start the Fastify server

Launch your Fastify server in development mode with live reload:

```shell
bun run dev
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your favorite
browser to explore the API of your Fastify server.
